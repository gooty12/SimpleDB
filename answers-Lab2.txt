Buffer policy
1. We used LRU, with a separate hashmap for maintaining the number of times a page was accessed.
2. We also had to implement insertTuple and deleteTuple, which were being invoked in the test cases.

BTreeFile
1. We used the reverse iterator till the middle index to identify the tuples that we had to split.

2. In split leaf we copied the first tuple in the second leaf to the parent.

3. We had to use a separate stack for the tuples in splitLeaf as iterator on Tuples along with deleteTuple does not work.

4. We also found out that during insertion into new leaf node, delete has to be done first otherwise the record id changes and delete throws an error.

5. We had to modify our implementation of Tuple and Tupledesc to handle null values in fields better.
