TupleDesc
Used number of fields currently for the hash function, will be improved with later implementation.

Catalog
Initialized all required variables (as mentioned in JavaDoc) to HashMap.
The Maps are initialized when the constructors are called.

BufferPool
Created a concurrent HashMap for the pages.

HeapPageId
Used table id and page number for hash code, will be improved with later implementation.

RecordId
Used hashcode on pid

HeapPage
Created an inner class for the iterator.

HeapFile
Created an inner class for the fileIterator.
Used random access file object to read from an offset value in the DbFile.

We spent close to 12 hours on the project.
We spent a chunk of our time understanding the format of the File object that heapFile class would be recieving.
There was also some churn involved in understanding and debugging the test cases, as the testUtil class has a lot of methods.
