Aggregate.java
Fetch only returns the next tuple. Merge is being done earlier in a separate method.

HashEquijoin.java
We are using a java.util map to hash the fields in one of the childs. In fetch next we look up the matching tuples in the map.

Join.java
In a nested loop, we are simply iterating over all the matching tuples. We have to maintain the firstTuple to ensure we do not select tuples randomly.

StringAggregator and IntegerAggregator.java
We are maintaining the merged tuples in a list. The iterator of that list is being returned in DB iterator.

Some changes to tupleDesc.java was required. We were earlier comparing tuple field names, which was removed and corrected.
